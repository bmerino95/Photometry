This directory contains a cfg file that each code uses. This file needs to be updated for each source. HST_filters.py needs to be in the same directoy as phot_plotter.py.

The order that the code should be used in is depicted below:
* Quick_Thumbnail.py
* Quick_Background_w_Mask.py
* watershed8.py
* single_clump_phot.py
* segmentation.py
* galaxy_phot.py
* phot_plotter
